Nucleus Mixins is an optional plugin for Minecraft 1.10.2 servers that attempts to provide features by hooking into the Minecraft
internals. [You can get Nucleus Mixins from Ore.](https://ore.spongepowered.org/Nucleus/Nucleus-Mixins). They must be installed in the
`/mods` directory on SpongeForge servers in order to work.

Unforatunately, due to the nature of core mods, Nucleus Mixins may not work with heavily modded servers.

### Improve world pre-generation

Mixins adds calls into the main Minecraft codebase to allow world pregeneration to operate more smoothly. These improvements have been
integrated into Sponge for 1.11.2
