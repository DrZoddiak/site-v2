This tutorial will help you create warps, set permissions so that players can use them, and provide other tips and tricks.

### You will need

* A Sponge server, installed and running
  > See the [Sponge quickstart guide](https://docs.spongepowered.org/stable/en/server/quickstart.html) if you require help creating a Sponge server.

* Nucleus installed and running
  > If you have not yet installed or run Nucleus and need help with this, [read the installation tutorial first](../first). 

* A player with permissions to create and manage warps
  > These permissions can be found on the [warps module page](../../modules/warp.html), but can be the `nucleus.warp` and `nucleus.warps` permissions
  > for the purposes of this tutorial


> Nucleus can be run without a permissions plugin, but if you decide not to use one, you will be restricted in how you can customise your server.
