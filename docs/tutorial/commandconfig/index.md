This tutorial will help you associate cooldowns, warmups and costs with command execution.

### You will need

* A Sponge server, installed and running
  > See the [Sponge quickstart guide](https://docs.spongepowered.org/stable/en/server/quickstart.html) if you require help creating a Sponge server.

* Nucleus installed and running, where the `config/nucleus/commands.conf` file has been generated
  > If you have not yet installed or run Nucleus and need help with this, [read the installation tutorial first](../first). 

* A permissions plugin
  > The Nucleus team does not recommend any specific permissions plugin. We suggest searching [Ore](https://ore.spongepowered.org) for such plugins.
