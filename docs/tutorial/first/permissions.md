## Setting Permissions

Nucleus, as an Essentials like plugin for Sponge, contains a lot of commands and as a result,
a lot of permissions that can seem daunting on the first run of a server. To help you get up
and running quickly, Nucleus provides two ways to set up permissions using your favourite 
permissions plugin.

If you want to set all permissions yourself, you can find a comprehensive list on our
[commands](../../commands2.html) and [permissions](../../permissions.html) pages. You can also
look on our specific module pages, or use any verbose logging tool that your permissions plugin
may provide.

> Nucleus is **not** a permissions management plugin. To make use of permissions, you must install a separate permissions plugin. [Such plugins can be found on Ore, Sponge's plugin distribution platform.](https://ore.spongepowered.org)
>
> This documentation site provides sample permission management commands for some popular permissions plugins. The plugin that is displayed can be selected using the selector in the top right. We do not endorse any third party plugins.

## Avoid using the wildcard `*` if possible

While the `*` permission is a temooting prospect, it does not work the same way as it did on Bukkit
and Essentials. It will grant you everything, even things you may not be expecting, unlike on these
legacy platforms. For example:

* There is an AFK exemption permission, `nucleus.afk.exempt.toggle`, activated by `*` 
* `nucleus.connectionmessages.disable` - give yourself `*` and you won't be broadcasted to the server
  when you join or leave

[For more information on why `*` is a bad idea, click here.](../nowildcard.html)

## Nucleus Permissions Quick Start

Every permission in Nucleus is internally assigned one of five roles, from the user role, permissions
that are typically given to all players, through to staff roles all the way up to a role that contains
permissions that are specialised and may do something that you may not expect if you granted the wildcard.
These roles are:

* `USER` - permissions that servers will generally grant to all players
* `MOD` - permissions for actions that are used by moderation staff for server order
* `ADMIN` - permissions that allow setting gameplay altering mechanics or server management
* `OWNER` - permissions that can cause severe server damage and generally should only be used by those with ultimate authority
* `NONE`  - permissions that are highly specialised, such as vanish on login, that should be decided on a case by case basis

Nucleus provides two ways to set up our suggested permission sets based on these roles in conjunction with your permissions plugin,
either through the `/nucleus setupperms` command, or the `nucleus.<role>` permissions, both of which are described below.

### The `/nucleus setupperms` command



### Role permissions (`nucleus.<role>`)

The following permissions that automatically grants defaults:

* `nucleus.user` that acts as a "super permission" for any permission labelled as `USER` in the permission tables
* `nucleus.mod` that acts as a "super permission" for any permission labelled as `MOD` in the permission tables
* `nucleus.admin` that acts as a "super permission" for any permission labelled as `ADMIN` in the permission tables
* `nucleus.owner` that acts as a "super permission" for any permission labelled as `OWNER` in the permission tables

**These do not, and will never, override any explicit permission that has been set.**

As an example, you give your moderators the `nucleus.mod` permission. This, for example, gives them permission to enter staff chat. However, maybe you don't want them to access this. If you set `nucleus.staffchat.base` as `false`, this will override `nucleus.mod`. The same can be said for parent permissions, if you set `nucleus.staffchat` to `false`, a check to `nucleus.staffchat.base` will return `false`, regardless of whether `nucleus.mod` is set.

While this is cleaner than using `/nucleus setupperms`, you must be aware of the following:

* These "role" permissions will _never_ be given by default by `setupperms`.
* Any permissions added to Nucleus that fall into one of these roles **WILL** be granted by default if you have the role permission. **It is the responsibility of the server owner to check for any new features that may be added to these roles**.
* `/nucleus setupperms` will continue to exist, and will **not** grant new permissions automatically if they are added in new releases (but will if
 you re-run the setupperms commands).

If you want to use our suggested template and do not mind following our recommendations, use the role permissions. If you want to use our suggested template but **DO** want full control over what permissions you have, remain with `/nucleus setupperms`.

If you do not want to use the role permissions, this can be turned off in the config by setting `core.enable-parent-perms` to `false` and reloading.
