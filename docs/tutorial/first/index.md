This tutorial will help you get set up with Nucleus.

### You will need

* A Sponge server, installed and running
  > See the [Sponge quickstart guide](https://docs.spongepowered.org/stable/en/server/quickstart.html) if you require help creating a Sponge server.

### You should have

* A permissions plugin
  > The Nucleus team does not recommend any specific permission plugin. We suggest searching [Ore](https://ore.spongepowered.org) for such plugins.

> Nucleus can be run without a permissions plugin, but if you decide not to use one, you will be restricted in how you can customise your server.
