Nucleus is a complex plugin that has been designed to be based on a module system, to allow users and plugins to turn off functionality
that they don't want, and to enable universal charging, cooldowns and warmups. While the underlying code that hooks all of Nucleus together
may seem scary, for most developers that want to add a feature into Nucleus will not need to see the internals, and will need to focus
on the development of the core feature they want to write.
