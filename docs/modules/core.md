## Introduction

The Core module contains functions that cannot be disabled. This module provides no game changing functionality on its
own.

## Plugin Management

The module is primarily concerned with ensuring that the internal functions of the plugin can be accessed. Included in the
command set are ways to force saving the latest data, reloading the plugin configuration, and deleting user information.

Note that changing module and command enabling statuses will not take effect until the server is restarted.

## Setting up default permissions
