## Introduction

Enables players to go invulnerable. Players who are invulnerable will not be targeted by mobs.

## Disabling PvP for invulnerable players

Sometimes, it is desirable to prevent invulnerable players from attacking others. As from 1.2.2, enabling the feature in `main.conf` (`disable-pvp-on-god`)
will activate this behaviour, overridable by granting the permission `nucleus.god.pvp.override` to select players.

## Permission Contexts

When players are invulnerable, Nucleus adds a permission context to the player permission set, so that you can change a player's
permissions when they are invulnerable.

Nucleus applies one context:

* `nucleus-invulnerable` will simply have the value "true" if the player is invulnerable.

Refer to your permission plugin documentation on how to set permissions on contexts.
