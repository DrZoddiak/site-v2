## Introduction

The Powertool module allows players to associate a held item with a command. The commands that are bound to items
will fire whenever some sort of interaction is detected, left- or right- click.

Powertools can be toggled off, meaning that powertools won't activate, but the association between item and command is
not lost. Use `/powertool toggle` to do so.
