## Introduction

The Name Ban module allows server owners to prevent players with certain names from joining their server, but is not
tied to an account, allowing the player to change their name in order to gain access. Usually, this
would be used to prevent someone with an inappropriate name from joining.

## Banning a name

To ban a name, simply run the command

```
/nameban <name> [reason]
```

A player with the supplied Minecraft IGN (case insensitive) will no longer be allowed to join.
